When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when a collaboration or backup is needed

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    pulling remote changes automatically may lead to multiple conflicts
    even before the current locally processed feature becomes beeing finished

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a clone of the repository but on the GitHub. It schould be use
    when somebodis else project is to be cloned preserving the recognition.

    clone is a copy of the branch, in contrast to the fork a copy of the
    repository can be cloned either from remote to the local repository, or
    some local repository can be cloned localy to some another directory.

    branch is a series of commits connected by referencing a parent commit.
    branches can be created as localy as remotely


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It supports in resolving merge conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    using a Dropbox woud be easier than an option of sending a file via Email

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    working on a separate branch allows sharing own changes to other members
    before it becomes merged into master. in this case code can be additionally
    reviewed. only one merge / conflict resolution is required, which can be
    performed at the moment when the new feature is ready.
